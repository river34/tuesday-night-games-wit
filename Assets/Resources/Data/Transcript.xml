<transcript>
<text start="10.376" dur="2.269">I&#39;d like you all to close your eyes.</text>
<text start="12.645" dur="2.701">Closed? Okay.</text>
<text start="15.346" dur="1.67">Now, you can&#39;t see me right now,</text>
<text start="17.016" dur="2.582">
but I&#39;m actually riding a unicycle, juggling hundreds of balls.
</text>
<text start="19.598" dur="0.798">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="20.396" dur="1.672">No, keep your eyes closed, though.</text>
<text start="22.068" dur="1.428">It&#39;s really great.</text>
<text start="23.496" dur="3.235">
But okay. So close your eyes, and picture an engineer.
</text>
<text start="28.416" dur="2.077">Everyone got a picture in their head?</text>
<text start="30.496" dur="1.36">Nod. Okay.</text>
<text start="31.856" dur="2.22">Open your eyes.</text>
<text start="34.436" dur="0.97">Raise your hand</text>
<text start="35.406" dur="2.487">if you pictured a guy sitting alone at a computer.</text>
<text start="37.996" dur="3.3">Okay. Maybe kind of nerdy, pocket protector.</text>
<text start="44.226" dur="3.02">Raise your hand if you pictured a train driver.</text>
<text start="47.246" dur="2.73">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="49.976" dur="2.687">That&#39;s a lot of hands.</text>
<text start="53.326" dur="1.04">Raise your hand</text>
<text start="54.366" dur="2.728">if you pictured a young guy in a hoodie,</text>
<text start="57.106" dur="2.803">maybe looks a little like Mark Zuckerberg perhaps.</text>
<text start="63.035" dur="2.996">
Raise your hand if you pictured someone who looks like me.
</text>
<text start="68.006" dur="2.42">Okay. Not a lot of hands.</text>
<text start="70.426" dur="1.97">Well, if you didn&#39;t raise your hand for me,</text>
<text start="72.396" dur="2.72">
I would like you to please get up and leave. (Laughter)
</text>
<text start="75.116" dur="1.32">No, just kidding.</text>
<text start="76.436" dur="3.545">
If you didn&#39;t raise your hand for me, it&#39;s all right. I get it all the time.
</text>
<text start="79.981" dur="1.965">Usually when I tell people I&#39;m an engineer,</text>
<text start="81.946" dur="1.46">they look at me and they say,</text>
<text start="83.406" dur="1.59">&quot;Ha! No, really, what do you do?&quot;</text>
<text start="84.996" dur="2.153">or they look at me and say,</text>
<text start="87.149" dur="2.817">
&quot;Oh, whoa, you must be some kind of genius&quot;
</text>
<text start="90.772" dur="2.314">or my favorite is when I told my mother</text>
<text start="93.086" dur="2.123">I wanted to major in engineering,</text>
<text start="95.246" dur="2.38">she said, &quot;Eww, why?&quot;</text>
<text start="97.626" dur="2.082">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="102.006" dur="3.131">
The truth is I&#39;m a female engineer, and I&#39;m a minority.
</text>
<text start="105.156" dur="4.021">
Only 11 percent of engineers in the U.S. are women.
</text>
<text start="109.466" dur="1.99">So why does this matter? Why do we care?</text>
<text start="111.456" dur="2.715">
So what. Let&#39;s just have the men do all the engineering.
</text>
<text start="114.176" dur="3.223">
Well, engineers are making some of the biggest advances
</text>
<text start="117.406" dur="1.383">in our society.</text>
<text start="118.796" dur="2.079">They&#39;re solving things like global warming,</text>
<text start="120.906" dur="1.89">making medical breakthroughs,</text>
<text start="122.796" dur="3.125">
some of the biggest technologies that are changing our lives.
</text>
<text start="125.921" dur="3.906">
These are things that we use every day as people that make our lives better.
</text>
<text start="130.406" dur="2.603">And with half the population being female,</text>
<text start="133.026" dur="2.22">we deserve to have the female perspective.</text>
<text start="135.246" dur="3.274">
It will only get better with the female perspective.
</text>
<text start="138.816" dur="2.97">But today engineering really is a boys&#39; club,</text>
<text start="143.829" dur="1.897">and I don&#39;t fit in.</text>
<text start="146.256" dur="1.88">But I&#39;m here today to share my story</text>
<text start="148.136" dur="2.45">about how I discovered a passion for engineering,</text>
<text start="150.586" dur="2.512">and I&#39;m here to make a bold claim:</text>
<text start="153.286" dur="2.34">I don&#39;t fit in, but I believe</text>
<text start="155.626" dur="2.164">that our little girls will.</text>
<text start="160.076" dur="3.438">So this is me when I was a little girl, age six.</text>
<text start="164.136" dur="1.89">I was a pretty normal kid.</text>
<text start="166.026" dur="2.44">I loved ballet and drawing</text>
<text start="168.466" dur="2.05">and riding bikes.</text>
<text start="170.516" dur="3.017">
I grew up in a small town in Rhode Island, age six.
</text>
<text start="174.586" dur="2">Coincidentally, this is around the age</text>
<text start="176.586" dur="1.37">where most girls start</text>
<text start="177.956" dur="3.127">
to lose an interest in math and science, this young.
</text>
<text start="182.196" dur="2.11">And it&#39;s interesting, some people think,</text>
<text start="184.306" dur="4.116">
&quot;Well, biologically maybe girls just aren&#39;t as good as those subjects
</text>
<text start="188.476" dur="3.346">
and that&#39;s just the way it is, you can&#39;t fight nature.&quot;
</text>
<text start="192.056" dur="2.33">Well, there was a study done very recently</text>
<text start="194.386" dur="2.585">across 65 countries around the world</text>
<text start="197.316" dur="3.34">
where they tested boys and girls on the same science test.
</text>
<text start="201.076" dur="3.03">Around the world the girls out-performed the boys,</text>
<text start="204.106" dur="1.94">but not in the U.S.</text>
<text start="206.046" dur="3.308">
What the study suggests is that it&#39;s not a biological thing.
</text>
<text start="209.706" dur="2.089">This is a cultural thing.</text>
<text start="213.781" dur="2.175">And this is our culture.</text>
<text start="215.956" dur="2.861">This is what we grew up in as girls.</text>
<text start="219.306" dur="2.629">The toy aisle, the perfect example of our culture,</text>
<text start="222.116" dur="2.872">where we are taught from a very young age</text>
<text start="224.988" dur="2.121">that we want to become princesses.</text>
<text start="227.376" dur="3.46">
I remember when I was a little girl, adults would pat me on the head --
</text>
<text start="230.836" dur="2.13">well, actually I come from a Jewish family;</text>
<text start="232.976" dur="2.37">so they would grab me by the punim and say,</text>
<text start="235.346" dur="3.518">
&quot;Debbie, you are so smart, good for you.&quot;
</text>
<text start="239.376" dur="3.104">
And I remember as a little girl being so disappointed,
</text>
<text start="242.506" dur="2.18">wishing that they told me I was pretty.</text>
<text start="244.686" dur="2.57">
I wanted to be pretty, I didn&#39;t want to be smart.
</text>
<text start="247.395" dur="3.101">
And by the time my senior year of high school rolled around,
</text>
<text start="250.636" dur="2.3">I was applying to college,</text>
<text start="252.936" dur="1.39">and I asked my math teacher</text>
<text start="254.326" dur="1.91">to write my recommendation letter.</text>
<text start="256.236" dur="2.599">
She said, &quot;Okay, Debbie, what do you plan to major in?
</text>
<text start="258.835" dur="1.471">I will write it in the letter.&quot;</text>
<text start="260.306" dur="1.45">And I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</text>
<text start="261.756" dur="2.15">She said, &quot;How about engineering?</text>
<text start="263.906" dur="2.07">I think you would really excel in it.&quot;</text>
<text start="265.976" dur="2.05">And I thought, engineering.</text>
<text start="268.026" dur="1.74">I closed my eyes --</text>
<text start="269.766" dur="2.64">and I pictured a train driver.</text>
<text start="272.406" dur="1.95">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="276.306" dur="2.85">I had no idea what engineering was,</text>
<text start="279.205" dur="2.271">and I was way too embarrassed to ask her.</text>
<text start="281.476" dur="1.61">I didn&#39;t want to sound stupid.</text>
<text start="283.086" dur="2.924">
But I thought, &quot;Ugh, no way, eww, engineering.
</text>
<text start="286.01" dur="3.394">
That&#39;s for boys. It&#39;s intimidating and boring.
</text>
<text start="290.239" dur="3.597">
And why would she ever think that a creative, artistic girl like me
</text>
<text start="293.836" dur="3.094">would ever like engineering. No way.&quot;</text>
<text start="297.96" dur="2.552">But I went off to Stanford, which was a big deal.</text>
<text start="300.536" dur="3.08">
In my high school they actually announced it over the loud speaker.
</text>
<text start="303.616" dur="0.96">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="304.576" dur="2.45">And when I got to Stanford my freshman year,</text>
<text start="307.026" dur="2.26">I had no idea what to major in.</text>
<text start="309.286" dur="3.244">And that message that that math teacher had said,</text>
<text start="312.53" dur="2.036">&quot;Engineering, you should give it a try,&quot;</text>
<text start="314.566" dur="1.74">it stuck in my head.</text>
<text start="316.306" dur="2.54">And so I thought, what the heck,</text>
<text start="318.846" dur="3.71">I&#39;m going to take ME101, just give it a try</text>
<text start="322.556" dur="2.75">
because I couldn&#39;t shake that advice that she had given me.
</text>
<text start="325.326" dur="3.286">
And I was so worried that it was going to be my first F.
</text>
<text start="328.646" dur="3.267">I was terrified, but I went into the class</text>
<text start="332.136" dur="2.05">and in that class I finally</text>
<text start="334.186" dur="2.91">learned what engineering really was.</text>
<text start="337.096" dur="1.67">And to my surprise,</text>
<text start="338.766" dur="2.73">we weren&#39;t fixing train engines.</text>
<text start="341.496" dur="2.12">In that class we got to invent</text>
<text start="343.616" dur="1.86">and design things.</text>
<text start="345.486" dur="3.493">
We had assignments like make a catapult out of a soda bottle
</text>
<text start="348.979" dur="3.961">
and a piece of string and five paper clips and a piece of foam core.
</text>
<text start="352.976" dur="3.188">It was so cool and so much fun.</text>
<text start="356.306" dur="2.462">And in that class, I learned that engineering</text>
<text start="358.768" dur="4.26">
is really the skill set to build anything you dream up in your head,
</text>
<text start="363.172" dur="1.404">whether it&#39;s a website</text>
<text start="364.576" dur="1.7">or a mobile app, to a bridge,</text>
<text start="366.276" dur="1.87">to a highway, anything.</text>
<text start="368.146" dur="1.47">That&#39;s what engineers build.</text>
<text start="369.616" dur="1.88">And what an amazing skill set.</text>
<text start="371.496" dur="3.327">
How empowering to be able to build whatever you want.
</text>
<text start="375.356" dur="3.771">But the problem was I felt kind of alone.</text>
<text start="379.886" dur="2.12">I was always one of a handful</text>
<text start="382.006" dur="1.8">of girls in my classes,</text>
<text start="384.706" dur="2.56">and I did not fit in.</text>
<text start="388.426" dur="2.18">In fact, only 20 percent</text>
<text start="390.606" dur="1.42">of undergraduate degrees</text>
<text start="392.026" dur="3.528">
in engineering and tech and science are awarded to women
</text>
<text start="395.554" dur="1.802">so it&#39;s a real problem.</text>
<text start="397.356" dur="2.07">But I stuck with it.</text>
<text start="399.426" dur="2.843">I loved the major, and I wanted to do it.</text>
<text start="402.696" dur="3.32">
That is, until I took an engineering drawing class.
</text>
<text start="407.733" dur="2.293">This was about halfway through my major</text>
<text start="410.026" dur="2">and I thought engineering and drawing,</text>
<text start="412.036" dur="1.77">this is going to be great.</text>
<text start="413.816" dur="1.04">I love art.</text>
<text start="414.856" dur="1.82">Finally, I&#39;m going to get to draw.</text>
<text start="416.686" dur="2.43">The problem was in this class you had to draw</text>
<text start="419.116" dur="2.93">in perspective, draw in 3-D</text>
<text start="422.046" dur="2.8">and for some reason I had this total mental block.</text>
<text start="424.896" dur="2.863">I was really struggling with the material.</text>
<text start="427.786" dur="2.48">
And our final assignment we had to put our drawings
</text>
<text start="430.266" dur="1.77">up on the wall for critique.</text>
<text start="432.036" dur="2.16">And you could tell, all the guys in the class --</text>
<text start="434.196" dur="1.949">
there were about 80 of them and five of us girls --
</text>
<text start="436.145" dur="2.531">
the guys had scribbled their drawing ten minutes before
</text>
<text start="438.676" dur="1.53">and slapped it up on the wall.</text>
<text start="440.206" dur="2.08">Meanwhile, I had spent hours the entire weekend.</text>
<text start="442.286" dur="3.249">
I didn&#39;t even go to any parties, working on my drawing.
</text>
<text start="445.876" dur="2.15">And when the professors went around the room</text>
<text start="448.026" dur="2.33">and they got to my drawing, they took a look at it</text>
<text start="450.356" dur="2.02">and they looked out into the room.</text>
<text start="452.376" dur="1.78">And they said, &quot;Raise your hand</text>
<text start="454.156" dur="3.041">if you think Debbie should pass this class.&quot;</text>
<text start="457.726" dur="3.39">
And I just stood there beet red, humiliated, looking around.
</text>
<text start="461.116" dur="2.31">Some people are kind of half raising their hands.</text>
<text start="463.426" dur="1.06">I was horrified.</text>
<text start="464.486" dur="2.04">
And they&#39;re like, &quot;Come on, raise your hand
</text>
<text start="466.526" dur="2.18">if you think Debbie should pass the class.&quot;</text>
<text start="468.706" dur="2.23">The room was silent.</text>
<text start="470.936" dur="2.47">Finally, my good friend piped up</text>
<text start="473.406" dur="1.82">and said, &quot;How dare you?</text>
<text start="475.226" dur="3.569">How dare you humiliate her in front of this room.</text>
<text start="479.636" dur="2.11">She, obviously, has put a lot of effort in;</text>
<text start="481.746" dur="4.008">
and it&#39;s your responsibility to teach her, not to make fun of her.&quot;
</text>
<text start="486.006" dur="2.5">Well, I&#39;m glad he said that, but even still,</text>
<text start="488.506" dur="1.96">the tears were streaming down my face.</text>
<text start="490.466" dur="2.942">And I ran out of the classroom and I thought,</text>
<text start="493.556" dur="1.87">this isn&#39;t for me.</text>
<text start="495.426" dur="1.95">I&#39;m not naturally good at this stuff,</text>
<text start="497.376" dur="2.51">maybe I should just give up engineering.</text>
<text start="499.886" dur="1.75">A lot of girls around this time</text>
<text start="501.636" dur="2.353">in their college career think the same thing.</text>
<text start="504.056" dur="1.59">But my friend came out,</text>
<text start="505.646" dur="2.487">and he said, &quot;Debbie, don&#39;t give up.</text>
<text start="508.166" dur="1.59">You can do it, and I&#39;ll help you.</text>
<text start="509.756" dur="1.65">We just have to work hard together.</text>
<text start="511.406" dur="2.182">You&#39;ll pick up this stuff. I know you will.</text>
<text start="513.635" dur="4.273">
So him and I used to go from that moment on to the library.
</text>
<text start="517.946" dur="3.767">
And sometimes we&#39;ll be there until three, four in the morning studying.
</text>
<text start="521.716" dur="2.73">And in that library I saw</text>
<text start="524.446" dur="2.01">all of those guys from my classes,</text>
<text start="526.456" dur="3.495">
the guys who I thought just knew it and it was so easy for them.
</text>
<text start="530.016" dur="3.075">
They it were there at the library at three in the morning.
</text>
<text start="533.116" dur="1.4">I caught them.</text>
<text start="534.516" dur="1.74">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="536.256" dur="3.821">
And I realized that it&#39;s not about being a born genius,
</text>
<text start="540.186" dur="1.86">it&#39;s about how hard you work.</text>
<text start="542.046" dur="1.61">This stuff takes a lot of work.</text>
<text start="543.656" dur="2.27">
But I worked really hard, and I re-did that drawing
</text>
<text start="545.926" dur="2.163">and I earned my degree.</text>
<text start="548.566" dur="2.78">Years later I did some research into this stuff,</text>
<text start="551.346" dur="2.924">
and I actually learned that I was at a disadvantage.
</text>
<text start="554.286" dur="1.66">Like a lot of other girls,</text>
<text start="555.946" dur="2.213">I had underdeveloped spatial skills.</text>
<text start="558.256" dur="2.83">
The other interesting thing that I learned is that kids
</text>
<text start="561.086" dur="2.818">who score better on spatial skills tests</text>
<text start="564.386" dur="2.221">grew up playing with construction toys.</text>
<text start="567.016" dur="2.079">Well, I thought isn&#39;t this a shame.</text>
<text start="569.116" dur="1.8">Me and my little sister growing up,</text>
<text start="570.916" dur="3.917">
our parents never bought us Legos or erector sets or Lincoln logs.
</text>
<text start="575.206" dur="2.862">We all thought that those were boys toys.</text>
<text start="578.206" dur="5.05">
I thought, those toys have been marketed to boys for over a hundred years.
</text>
<text start="584.176" dur="2.454">And they get them interested in math and science.</text>
<text start="586.63" dur="2.376">
Meanwhile, all we get are the dolls and makeup kits
</text>
<text start="589.006" dur="1.77">and it&#39;s not fair.</text>
<text start="591.076" dur="1.98">So I thought, well, I&#39;m an engineer now.</text>
<text start="593.056" dur="1.53">I have a degree.</text>
<text start="594.586" dur="2.1">I can make anything I want now.</text>
<text start="596.686" dur="2.49">
I&#39;m going to make an engineering toy for girls,
</text>
<text start="600.046" dur="2">and I&#39;m going to give them the opportunity</text>
<text start="602.046" dur="1.98">that I didn&#39;t have so that they can discover</text>
<text start="604.026" dur="3.258">a passion for engineering much earlier than I did.</text>
<text start="608.056" dur="1.87">So I got to work.</text>
<text start="609.926" dur="4.285">
I quit my job and I worked out of my apartment for months,
</text>
<text start="614.906" dur="2.4">making a prototype</text>
<text start="617.306" dur="3.54">out of thread spools and wooden dowels,</text>
<text start="620.876" dur="2.866">pieces I could find from the hardware store.</text>
<text start="624.346" dur="3.733">
I wanted to find a way to help girls develop their spatial skills.
</text>
<text start="628.226" dur="2.18">I did all of this research.</text>
<text start="630.406" dur="1.49">I met with little girls,</text>
<text start="631.896" dur="2.01">and I found something really interesting.</text>
<text start="633.906" dur="1.4">I&#39;d buy construction toys</text>
<text start="635.306" dur="1.85">and watch them play with them</text>
<text start="637.156" dur="1.673">to see how they could be improved</text>
<text start="639.416" dur="3.12">
and time and time again the girls would get bored with the toys.
</text>
<text start="642.536" dur="2.27">
And so I would say, &quot;Well, what is your favorite toy?&quot;
</text>
<text start="644.806" dur="1.83">And they would run upstairs</text>
<text start="646.636" dur="1.75">and they would bring back down a book</text>
<text start="648.386" dur="1.29">and they&#39;d say,</text>
<text start="649.676" dur="2.22">
&quot;I love reading. Let&#39;s read together.&quot;
</text>
<text start="651.926" dur="3.841">
So I came up with a really simple &quot;aha&quot; idea:
</text>
<text start="657.721" dur="2.538">What if I put those two things together.</text>
<text start="660.276" dur="1.65">Spatial plus verbal,</text>
<text start="661.926" dur="2.96">a construction set plus stories.</text>
<text start="664.886" dur="3.4">
And what if those stories were about a girl engineer character
</text>
<text start="668.286" dur="2.02">named Goldie Blocks.</text>
<text start="670.306" dur="2.71">And as she goes on adventures,</text>
<text start="673.016" dur="3.15">she solves problems by building simple machines.</text>
<text start="676.166" dur="2.91">
And so the girls read along, and they get to build with Goldie
</text>
<text start="679.076" dur="1.97">and it would bring in a role model,</text>
<text start="681.046" dur="1.78">and it would bring in the narrative</text>
<text start="682.826" dur="1.46">that they so loved.</text>
<text start="684.286" dur="1.9">I made this prototype,</text>
<text start="686.186" dur="1.78">and I went around the Bay Area</text>
<text start="687.966" dur="1.92">testing it on hundreds of kids;</text>
<text start="690.679" dur="1.567">and it worked.</text>
<text start="692.246" dur="1.55">I had little girls</text>
<text start="693.796" dur="2.25">in tutus building belt drives.</text>
<text start="696.046" dur="1.61">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="697.656" dur="1.52">It was awesome.</text>
<text start="699.176" dur="2.536">And I knew I was on to something.</text>
<text start="701.766" dur="3.63">So I had all of these ram shackled prototypes</text>
<text start="705.396" dur="1.34">in my apartment;</text>
<text start="706.736" dur="2.945">
and I&#39;ve been working for months like a hermit, not showering.
</text>
<text start="709.681" dur="2.295">And a friend of mine said,</text>
<text start="711.976" dur="2.49">
&quot;Debbie, do you want to take this to the next level?
</text>
<text start="714.466" dur="1.55">Do you trust me?&quot;</text>
<text start="716.016" dur="2.5">
I said, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; &quot;Do you trust me?&quot;
</text>
<text start="718.516" dur="1.91">
I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay. We&#39;re not in a movie.
</text>
<text start="720.426" dur="1.38">What are you talking about?&quot;</text>
<text start="721.806" dur="2.31">He said: &quot;You need to apply</text>
<text start="724.116" dur="2.63">to this tech accelerator program.&quot;</text>
<text start="726.746" dur="3.077">It is the most elite program in Silicon Valley.</text>
<text start="730.812" dur="2.084">All the top engineers around the world vie</text>
<text start="732.896" dur="1.86">for a position in this program.</text>
<text start="734.756" dur="2.56">You need to apply.&quot;</text>
<text start="737.316" dur="1.76">So I applied,</text>
<text start="739.076" dur="2.46">and I got in to the big interview day.</text>
<text start="741.536" dur="3.086">And I walked into a room of Mark Zuckerburgs</text>
<text start="745.418" dur="2.098">sitting there on their computers.</text>
<text start="747.516" dur="1.31">Meanwhile, me walking in,</text>
<text start="748.826" dur="2.264">the chick with the physical prototype.</text>
<text start="751.236" dur="3.15">And I had a napkin over it because, obviously,</text>
<text start="754.386" dur="2.38">I had to protect my intellectual property.</text>
<text start="756.766" dur="1.29">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="758.056" dur="2.43">And so I&#39;m walking in there</text>
<text start="760.486" dur="2.98">and gosh, do I not fit in.</text>
<text start="763.466" dur="1.95">And one of the guys pipes up</text>
<text start="765.416" dur="3.559">
and says, &quot;Oh, did you bring us cookies?&quot;
</text>
<text start="768.975" dur="2.103">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="771.688" dur="2.758">Well, my confidence was pretty shot;</text>
<text start="774.446" dur="1.93">and needless to say,</text>
<text start="776.376" dur="2.3">I didn&#39;t get into the accelerator.</text>
<text start="778.736" dur="3.469">
They didn&#39;t understand why on earth I would add a book.
</text>
<text start="782.676" dur="2.93">So, they didn&#39;t get it.</text>
<text start="785.976" dur="1.46">But I didn&#39;t give up.</text>
<text start="787.436" dur="3.049">
So I brought my prototype to the New York toy fair.
</text>
<text start="790.686" dur="3.143">
It&#39;s the international biggest toy show in the U.S.
</text>
<text start="794.326" dur="2.71">
And I thought, okay, this is it. I&#39;m going to go.
</text>
<text start="797.036" dur="2.127">I&#39;m going to show toy industry veterans.</text>
<text start="799.176" dur="2.59">
I&#39;m going to talk to store owners and see what they have to say
</text>
<text start="801.766" dur="2.57">about my engineering toy for girls.</text>
<text start="804.346" dur="3.02">
And I walked in there thinking toy fair is going to be awesome.
</text>
<text start="807.366" dur="2.2">There&#39;s going to be all these creative types,</text>
<text start="809.566" dur="2.02">mad scientists, kids running around,</text>
<text start="811.586" dur="2.03">it&#39;s going to be so cool.</text>
<text start="813.616" dur="1.797">It was a bunch of old men in suits.</text>
<text start="817.066" dur="1.79">I don&#39;t fit in.</text>
<text start="818.856" dur="1.85">Come on. I got through engineering,</text>
<text start="820.706" dur="1.92">and now this?</text>
<text start="822.656" dur="2.1">So I showed people my prototype;</text>
<text start="824.756" dur="3.08">and they all kind of looked at me with pity.</text>
<text start="828.176" dur="2.501">And they whispered me a well-known</text>
<text start="830.726" dur="1.851">industry secret:</text>
<text start="833.056" dur="3.486">construction toys for girls don&#39;t sell.</text>
<text start="836.846" dur="1.87">And they took my by the arm,</text>
<text start="838.716" dur="4.032">and they showed me what does sell, the pink aisle.</text>
<text start="843.656" dur="2.11">And they said this is the way it is</text>
<text start="845.766" dur="2.783">and so we&#39;ve come full circle.</text>
<text start="848.746" dur="2.8">And I felt pretty dejected after that toy fair,</text>
<text start="851.556" dur="1.99">but I wasn&#39;t willing to give up.</text>
<text start="853.556" dur="2">Just because this is the way things are,</text>
<text start="855.556" dur="2.794">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s how they have to be.</text>
<text start="858.506" dur="3.498">And so I took my prototype.</text>
<text start="862.276" dur="2.02">I partnered with a factory,</text>
<text start="864.296" dur="2.744">and I turned it into a real toy.</text>
<text start="867.236" dur="4.222">
The thing was the factory minimum order was 5,000 toys
</text>
<text start="872.686" dur="1.99">and with all of this rejection,</text>
<text start="874.676" dur="2.956">I didn&#39;t know if people were going to want it;</text>
<text start="877.796" dur="2.06">so I put it up on Kickstarter.</text>
<text start="880.645" dur="2.531">I had a goal of raising $150,000</text>
<text start="883.326" dur="3.629">in 30 days to make this toy a reality.</text>
<text start="887.646" dur="1.88">I hit go.</text>
<text start="889.526" dur="1.78">I crossed my fingers,</text>
<text start="891.366" dur="2.732">and I hit my goal in four days.</text>
<text start="895.016" dur="3.158">(Applause)</text>
<text start="904.486" dur="2.52">And our minimum production,</text>
<text start="907.006" dur="2.27">it didn&#39;t end up being 5,000 units.</text>
<text start="909.356" dur="3.1">It ended up being over 20,000.</text>
<text start="912.456" dur="2.12">I had stores calling from all over the world</text>
<text start="914.576" dur="2.78">
saying, &quot;My customers are coming in, they want Goldie Blocks.
</text>
<text start="917.356" dur="1.55">What is this Goldie Blocks?&quot;</text>
<text start="918.906" dur="2.06">I had parents calling in saying,</text>
<text start="920.966" dur="2.87">
&quot;Yes, my daughter is more than just a princess.&quot;
</text>
<text start="923.836" dur="1.06">(Laughter)</text>
<text start="924.896" dur="2.38">I had the press writing articles all about it.</text>
<text start="927.286" dur="1.92">The world was waiting for this.</text>
<text start="929.206" dur="1.47">They wanted this.</text>
<text start="930.676" dur="2.03">The toy industry had it wrong.</text>
<text start="932.706" dur="2.07">Yeah, sure, some girls like princesses</text>
<text start="934.776" dur="0.99">and tiaras,</text>
<text start="935.766" dur="1.84">and I like that stuff too,</text>
<text start="937.606" dur="2.15">but there&#39;s so much more to us than that.</text>
<text start="939.766" dur="2.27">There&#39;s so much potential.</text>
<text start="942.036" dur="1.46">And for me,</text>
<text start="943.496" dur="1.81">I couldn&#39;t be more happy</text>
<text start="945.306" dur="4.037">
to be putting my engineering skills into this product
</text>
<text start="949.566" dur="2.69">because it leverages not only the math and science</text>
<text start="952.256" dur="1.9">that I worked so hard to learn,</text>
<text start="954.156" dur="2.486">but also leverages my creativity.</text>
<text start="956.936" dur="2.264">And engineering is such a creative thing,</text>
<text start="959.206" dur="1.57">and I never knew it.</text>
<text start="960.776" dur="3.389">
And it&#39;s so fun for me to get to use my creative voice
</text>
<text start="964.256" dur="2.59">and my artistic skills as a part of engineering.</text>
<text start="966.866" dur="1.48">And it&#39;s so important</text>
<text start="968.346" dur="2.05">that we include that perspective.</text>
<text start="970.396" dur="2.527">And the other thing that&#39;s so great about it</text>
<text start="972.923" dur="1.983">is engineering is for people.</text>
<text start="974.906" dur="2.03">We&#39;re designing things for people.</text>
<text start="976.936" dur="2.11">So how fun for me to get</text>
<text start="979.046" dur="1.68">to spend my time playing</text>
<text start="980.726" dur="2.03">and learning with little girls</text>
<text start="982.756" dur="1.92">and understanding what their needs are</text>
<text start="984.676" dur="1.86">and designing things for them.</text>
<text start="986.536" dur="2.52">It couldn&#39;t be more rewarding.</text>
<text start="989.056" dur="2.725">
Our toys are now hitting the doorsteps of thousands of girls
</text>
<text start="991.781" dur="1.845">around the world.</text>
<text start="993.626" dur="2.83">I just got an email from a mom</text>
<text start="996.456" dur="3.13">who said, &quot;We love playing Goldie Blocks.</text>
<text start="999.586" dur="1.32">
My four and a half year old, halfway through the game
</text>
<text start="1000.906" dur="4.037">
looked at me and said, &quot;Mommy, am I an engineer?&quot;
</text>
<text start="1006.296" dur="2.789">And her mom said, &quot;Yes, sweetie, you can be.</text>
<text start="1009.156" dur="2.294">You can be anything.&quot;</text>
<text start="1011.716" dur="2.7">For so long, for so many years,</text>
<text start="1014.416" dur="2.57">I felt like I didn&#39;t fit in</text>
<text start="1016.986" dur="3.492">but now I feel like I belong here.</text>
<text start="1020.686" dur="3.622">I feel like I belong, and our little girls do too.</text>
<text start="1025.236" dur="1.381">Thank you.</text>
<text start="1026.617" dur="1.942">(Applause)</text>
