# Ada's journey: a player's story

This is a video player / platformer game created in under 8 hours for Women in Tech Demo Day, DC, 2017.

As a female indie game developer myself, I feel naturally connected to female engineers working in the industry, and I can relate to all the hardness they have been through.

This app will analysis a female engineer's talk, and procedurally generate a platformer game that the audience needs to play while listening to the talking.

This game will visualise the hardness times and struggles faced by the speaker, and help the audience empathise.

It's a persuasive game using digital representation of a personal true story. It becomes the player's story when they play the game.
